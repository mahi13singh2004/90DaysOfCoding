DSA:
Solved POTD!

CP:
- LEETCODE RATINGS UPDATED:
BIWEEKLY (Solved 2 questions) -> +43

OVERALL -> +9

- Participated In Codeforces Round 943 (Div3). This was my 19th contest! Was able to solve 5 questions (personal best). Got stuck on the very first question cuz didnt read multiple submissions were accepted ðŸ˜… .Questions today did not require any special data structure and could be solved just with control statements/loops and mathematical logic. Problem 'D' Took a lot of time to implement. 
Had a rank of under ~800 during the contest which finally got pushed to 2k by the end!
