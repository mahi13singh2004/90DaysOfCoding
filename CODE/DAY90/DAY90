Dear connections ‚òÄÔ∏è!
I am glad to announce the end of my hashtag#90daysofchallenge. Here is a brief summary of past 3 months:

2]Participated in LeetCode weekly/biweekly contests, averaging 2 questions solved per contest (crossed the 1600 mark in LC)(top 22.98%)
3]Solved 100 questions on LeetCode and 82 problems on Coding Ninjas, earning various badges.

WEB DEV:
1]Completed core concepts of HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and JS.
2]Created many clones and mini-projects using HTML/CSS.
3]Initiated a JS project.

This has been most rewarding so far:
1]Progressed from 1*(1378) to 2*(1545) in CodeChef (11 contests)(in top 21k in-country)
2]Advanced from newbie(785) to pupil(1245) in Codeforces (18 contests).
3]Improved from 99 to 205 on AtCoder.
4]Participated in TLE Eliminators coding contest, qualified for regionals(pune) but couldn't attend due to college exams!

OPEN SOURCE:
1] Learnt git and giGitHubunctions and commands!
2] Participated in social winter of code but couldn't contribute substantially!
3] Got selected for devfolio social summer of code (will ensure maximum contribution)
4] Got selected for girl script summer of code (will ensure maximum contribution)

These 3 months have been nothing short of learning and doing new stuff! Was able to cover a lot of stuff with dedication and consistency. 

Will ensure this consistency and keep learning new things. Will soon start participating in hackathons and prepare for upcoming opportunities (hacker cup, icpc, SIH, etc)

Thanks to all the connections for being a part of this 90-day journey! Until next timeüôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è!
