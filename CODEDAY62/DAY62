ðŸš€Day 62 of hashtag#90daysofcoding challenge:
Took part in 'code uncode' Online preliminary round hosted by KJSCE CodeCell, DJSCE CodeStars, and CSI-SPIT. Was able to solve 2 questions. Tried 5-6 approaches for the 3rd question and none of them worked! Waiting for results, let's see if I qualify for Pune/Mumbai regionals!
Great initiative by TLE Eliminators and the colleges involved. Hope to attend more such contests in the future!
